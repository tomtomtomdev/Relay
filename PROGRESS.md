# PROGRESS — Relay

Append one entry per completed slice. Newest at the bottom. This file is the source
of truth for resuming after a context clear — write it so a fresh session can pick up
with no other memory.

## Entry template

```
## Slice N — <title>   (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Status: complete | blocked
- What landed: <1–3 lines>
- Key files: <paths added/changed>
- Tests: <count> passing; covers <what>
- Decisions / deviations from PLAN: <none | …>
- Commit: <hash> "slice N: …"
- Next: Slice N+1 — <title>. Watch out for: <gotcha if any>

## Slice 0 — Skeleton menu-bar app   (2026-06-26)
- Status: complete
- What landed: `MenuBarExtra` app with `LSUIElement = YES` (menu-bar resident, no Dock
  icon, window-close ≠ quit). Status glyph driven by a pure `AppStatus` model; dropdown
  shows status + Quit. Removed the Xcode `ContentView` template.
- Key files: `Relay/AppStatus.swift` (new), `Relay/RelayMenu.swift` (new),
  `Relay/RelayApp.swift` (now `MenuBarExtra`), `Relay/ContentView.swift` (deleted),
  `RelayTests/RelayTests.swift` (AppStatusTests), `Relay.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`.
- Tests: 4 unit tests passing (`AppStatusTests`) — covers the four SPEC §4 states,
  non-empty + distinct glyphs, non-empty labels. UI launch tests also green.
- Decisions / deviations from PLAN: none. `AppStatus` is `Sendable`/`@MainActor`-free
  per the strict-concurrency guardrail so later actors can read it without isolation hops.
- Commit: see `git log --grep "slice 0:"` (committed this slice).
- Next: Slice 1 — Config model + Keychain. Watch out for: secrets must never appear in
  any `description`/log helper; `KeychainStore` needs an injectable service name so tests
  hit a test keychain, never the login keychain.
